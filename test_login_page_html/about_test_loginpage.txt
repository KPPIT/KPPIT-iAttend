Streamlit HTML Component Login Issue

Problem Summary:
The login system using Streamlit's HTML components isn't working properly. 
The HTML login form can't successfully communicate with the Streamlit app backend, resulting in authentication failures even with correct credentials.

Root Cause Analysis
- Communication Breakdown: Streamlit's HTML components run in an iframe with strict security restrictions that prevent reliable message passing between the component and the main app.
- Session State Mismanagement: The login data isn't being properly passed from the HTML component to Streamlit's session state.
- Complexity Overhead: The current approach requires complex message passing that Streamlit isn't designed to handle natively.

Technical Challenges
- postMessage Limitations: The window.postMessage() API used for communication is subject to cross-origin restrictions in iframes.
- Streamlit Architecture: Streamlit wasn't designed for bidirectional communication with embedded HTML components.
- State Synchronization: Maintaining synchronized state between the HTML component and Streamlit's Python backend is challenging.
